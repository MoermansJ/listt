			<p>
				Listt.io grew out of the desire to develop appropriate technology solutions for regenerative
				agriculture. <br />
				This brand of farming places an emphasis on prioritising soil health while
				building thriving food production businesses. <br />
				It’s a climate solution - well managed soils sequester carbon - scaled to a global scale, this is a significant tool to cool our planet.<br />
				Healthy soils produce healthy food and require less inputs - but also require new tools (less
				tillage and chemicals mean more weeds and manual tasks). <br />
				Finally, it’s good business -	when your food production uses less resources, growers and farmers are more in control of
				their economics and less reliant on long supply chains.
